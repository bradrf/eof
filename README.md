# EOF

Welcome! Perhaps you're here for a small bit of insight into my state-of-mind? If so, continue on, my fair (faerie?) reader. If you landed here by chance, however, what's provided below is unlikely to be of any use, but I'll let you be the judge. Maybe.

### EOF?

It's an initialism for "end of file," a software term that felt fit-for-purpose. EOF is a special termination value used to indicate to a reader that there is no more content and the input can be closed. This will effectively be my own life's terminator, or perhaps more of a coda. Unless there's an afterlife with git installed, it's unlikely I'll have more to say.

*Be warned:* this content isn’t necessarily going to give you any direct answers. It's merely a small peek behind the curtain, heavily skewed. I cannot prevent today's feelings from (mis)interpreting yesterday's memories. That said, every word written is my own and in the order I've chosen (the free will debate, notwithstanding). I intentionally avoided any help from grammar or AI tools to ensure the result is 100% me—for good or bad.

### TL;DR

It's a tricky thing attempting to distill one's own life into a set of sentences, let alone a single word, but for me, the one thing I feel overwhelmingly is shame. I'm sure there have been good times, and I can even think of a few. Yet, every one has the feeling of veneer covering cheap particle board embarrassment. I am resplendent in masks of repression, cover-up, and artificial self-confidence (probably need to update linkedin).

My sincere hope is that the information I provide may help you achieve a small amount of empathy and understanding. In a perfect world, it might even lead you to forgiveness.

Regardless, I've attempted to avoid too much coloring—keeping it as raw and transparent as I can muster. Yet, it's all rebuilt, replayed, and reconstituted memory, which we know is extremely faulty. YMMV, IANAL, etc.
