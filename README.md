# EOF

Welcome! Perhaps you're here for a small bit of insight into my state-of-mind? If so, continue on, my fair (faerie?) reader. If you landed here by chance, however, what's provided below is unlikely to be of any use, but I'll let you be the judge. Maybe.

### EOF?

It's an initialism for "end of file," a software term that felt fit-for-purpose. EOF is a special termination value used to indicate to a reader that there is no more content and the input can be closed. This will effectively be my own life's terminator, or perhaps more of a coda. Unless there's an afterlife with git installed, it's unlikely I'll have more to say.
